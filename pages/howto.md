# How To Guide: Using Healing Crystals  
Crystals are believed to have special energy that will effect various aspects of your life and well-being. Crystals have high vibrational frequencies and interact with the body's energy field, and in doing so, they channel and direct energy, unblock and align chakras, and guide our intentions. 

## Cleansing  
Crystals can hold negative energy, so it's important to cleanse your crystals before use, especially after they have first been purchased. 
Some methods of cleansing crystals include:  
* **Running under water:** Run the crystals under water for about one minute to wash away negative energy.  
* **Submerge in salt water:** Add a teaspoon of salt to a bowl of water, then submerge your crystals and let them rest for at least an hour.  
* **Smudging:** Burning sage purifies and clears negative energy. Smudge each crystal individually.  
*Note: Be sure to check if your crystals are waterproof before doing any rituals involving water. For example, selenite, calcite, and azurite should not be submerged in water.*  

## Charging  
Crystals can also be depleted of energy when they are used, so make sure to charge them frequently. Some methods of charging include:  
* **Sunlight:** Let your crystals sit outside in the sunshine, or inside in a spot with lots of sunlight.  
* **Moonlight:** Similar to charging with sunlight, placing your crystals outside or inside under the moonlight will also charge them.  
* **Place in soil:** Bury your crystals in the soil overnight to re-strengthen their connection to the Earth. This can be done outside or even in the potting soil of your houseplant!  
*Note: As with water, check to make sure your crystals can be placed in direct sunlight, as sometimes the sun can fade or damage them.*  

## Using Your Healing Crystals
After cleansing and charging, it's time to use your crystals! There is no right or wrong way to use healing crystals, but here are some ideas:  
* Wear crystals as jewelry, in your pocket, or in your wallet/purse  
* Place crystals around your home to increase the energy of different rooms  
* For meditation, you can hold them in your hands, or place them on your body to align and unblock your chakras.  
* Place crystals in or around your bath to receive healing energy  

Before you work with your crystals, make sure you set your intentions first. Focus on the exact problem and your desired solution, then say your intention out loud while holding the crystal that aligns with that energy. Visualize the healing energy leaving the crystal and entering your body or home.

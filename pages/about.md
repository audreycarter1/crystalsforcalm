## About the Collection

The 26 objects in the Crystals for Calm digital collection come from the private collection of Audrey Carter, a graduate student in the Midwest. Audrey began collecting crystals about four years ago when she learned about their uses for meditation and healing. Recently, Audrey noticed a gap in databases about crystals--they were either highly scientific or created for the sole purpose of advertising and selling crystals. Crystals for Calm aims to reconcile the two by providing a collection to serve as a crystal knowledge base that is easy for the general population to understand, and does not have an ulterior motive of buying or selling.  
Whether you are new to healing crystals or have an established collection, Crystals for Calm will help you learn which crystals will be best for you and your goals.

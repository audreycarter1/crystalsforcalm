## Technical Information

### Metadata Application Profile  

**Context:** *Crystals for Calm* is the private collection of a graduate student in the Midwest. The collection has been developed over the course of four years, and it was originally intended for meditative purposes.  

**Content:** This collection will be comprised of born-digital photographs of 26 individual crystals and descriptive metadata about each crystal. The collection will focus on healing properties of crystals and how to effectively use them for meditation, chakra balancing, and manifestation/attraction.

**Users:** Primary users are people who collect and utilize crystals for healing practices, are looking for more information about their crystals, and who are looking for specific crystals to help with certain aspects of life. Secondary users are people who want to identify a crystal they have acquired or who just have a general interest in healing crystals.
